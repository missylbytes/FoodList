                    <h4>FIRST: Artists Make Collections</h4>
                    <p>Artists group similar works of art together into "collections" which can be displayed in a business.  They're basically curating your own gallery show!</p>
                    
                    <h4>SECOND: Biz Owner choose Art Collections</h4>
                    <p>Business owner decide if the art may be a good fit for their business based on the look, the categories, and the monthly rental amount of the art.</p>
                   
                    <h4>THIRD: Biz Owner Sends Artist Info about their Business</h4>
                    <p>Because most artists aren't charging market value, they need info to evaluate the worth of hanging their art in that business.</p>
                   
                    <h4>FINALLY: Artist and Biz Owner Finalize Terms</h4>
                    <p>Win - Win! Business Owners get Art.  Artists get exposure (and maybe some money).</p>
